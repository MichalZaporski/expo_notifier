# ExpoNotifier

A Ruby gem for sending push notifications via Expo, serving as a lightweight and flexible alternative to the official Expo library. It is built on Faraday for HTTP communication and offers greater configurability, along with full support for Sorbet type checking.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add expo_notifier
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install expo_notifier
```

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
